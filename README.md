# Tailwind CSS Responsive Directive Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's responsive design features. The problem stems from unexpected interactions between different screen size directives (`@media` queries) and utility classes applied to elements.  The challenge lies in understanding and resolving conflicts that arise from overlapping styles or inconsistent application of directives.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Resize the browser window to observe inconsistent behavior.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file provides a corrected version. The solution might involve refactoring your CSS classes, clarifying the order of directives, or employing more specific or explicit selectors to avoid style conflicts.  In some instances, using Tailwind's `@apply` directive or creating custom responsive classes can help resolve complex scenarios.

This example highlights the importance of careful planning and well-structured CSS when leveraging Tailwind's responsive capabilities.  Thorough testing across various screen sizes is crucial to ensure consistent rendering and avoid these types of conflicts.
